Imposter Party Game — Web App Specification
=========================================

1. Overview
-----------
Product Name: Imposter  
Platform: Mobile web app (mobile-first)  
Primary Device Target: iPhone (portrait)

Purpose:
A simple party game used to secretly distribute roles. One phone is passed
around the group. One player is the Imposter; all others see the same word.

Words MUST be generated randomly from a centralized word library via a backend
(API-based). No local static word list.


2. Target Device & Layout
------------------------
Design size: 390 × 844 px (iPhone 14/15 portrait)
Orientation: Portrait only
Mobile-first, touch-first UI
Responsive for other phones but optimized for iPhone


3. Game Rules / Logic
--------------------
1. User enters number of players (N)
2. App requests a random word from backend
3. App randomly selects ONE imposter index from [1..N]
4. For each player:
   - Player taps "Reveal Word"
   - Player sees:
       - The word (normal player), OR
       - "You are the Imposter"
   - Player taps "Next Player"
   - Phone is passed to the next person
5. After Player N, setup is complete

Backend is only used for word generation.
No authentication, no persistence, no scoring.

5. State Management
-------------------
Client-side Game State:

GameState {
  totalPlayers: number
  currentPlayerIndex: number
  imposterIndex: number
  selectedWord: string
}

Rules:
- imposterIndex is random from 1..totalPlayers
- selectedWord is fetched ONCE per game
- Word never changes mid-game
- State resets on "New Game"


6. Backend Word Service
----------------------

Purpose:
Provide a random word from a curated library.

API Endpoint:
GET /api/random-word

Response:
{
  "word": "Airport"
}

Backend Requirements:
- Word list stored server-side
- Random selection per request
- No authentication
- No user tracking
- Extremely low latency

Optional Extensions (NOT required for MVP):
- Categories (places, objects, food)
- Difficulty levels
- Custom word submissions (future)


7. Visual Design
----------------
Style:
- Cute, clean party-game aesthetic
- Bright but soft colors
- Rounded corners everywhere
- Minimal text per screen

Typography:
- Single rounded sans-serif font
  (Inter, Poppins, or system font)

Buttons:
- Minimum height: 48px
- Large rounded corners (16–24px radius)
- One primary action per screen


8. CSS / Layout Guidelines
--------------------------
- Center content vertically using Flexbox
- Max-width container:
  max-width: 390px;
  margin: 0 auto;

- Padding:
  padding: 24px;

- Disable text selection:
  user-select: none;


9. Technical Constraints
------------------------
- Backend required ONLY for word generation
- No accounts
- No ads
- No analytics
- No persistent storage
- Frontend must still function gracefully if API fails
  (show error + retry)


10. Suggested Architecture
--------------------------
Frontend:
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript OR React

Backend:
- Simple REST API
- Node.js / serverless function acceptable
- Stateless

Deployment:
- Frontend: Vercel / Netlify
- Backend: Serverless function or lightweight API


11. Explicit Non-Goals
---------------------
- Voting
- Timers
- Scoring
- Multiplayer syncing
- Chat
- Game moderation logic

This app ONLY distributes roles.


12. Success Criteria
-------------------
- Game starts in under 10 seconds
- Backend word fetch < 300ms
- Fully usable one-handed
- No accidental reveals
- Feels fun and polished immediately
