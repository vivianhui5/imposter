# imposter

a party game where one person is secretly the imposter.

## how to play

1. pass your phone around
2. everyone taps "reveal" to see their role
3. one person gets "imposter" — everyone else gets the same word
4. go in a circle twice, each person says one related word
5. regular players: hint at the word but don't be obvious
6. imposter: try to blend in and figure out the word
7. if the imposter says the actual word, they lose
8. vote on who's the imposter
